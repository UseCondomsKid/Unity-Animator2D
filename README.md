A simple, and performant alternative for unity's animation system
*This is still in really early development, it was written in like a day.*

Animation used in example: https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords

If you want to use this, just copy the "2D Animation System" folder found inside the "Assets" folder into your project
